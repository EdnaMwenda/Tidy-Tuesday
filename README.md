# Tidy-Tuesday
The intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions.
This repository contains some of the  Tidy Tuesday data sets that I've had a great time manipulating and 
learning from and I hope they inspire you too to do more R related stuff.
This is just a guide on various areas around data visualization. They are not all complete scripts but I'm getting around to that, haha
